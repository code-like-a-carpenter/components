# Renderers

There are a lot of scenarios where we don't know exactly _what_ we plan on
rendering. For example, let's say we wanted to render an arbitrary CSV into a
table. Our CSV parser could recognize column headings, numbers, dates, and
possibly even booleans, but if we don't know a field's type a priori, then we
can't apply appropriate formatting.

Renders are type-specific components that do close to the right thing when we
can't know exactly what the data looks in advance.

All renderers must accept a `value` prop. Renderers may accept additional
formatting props. Since the whole point is to instantiate renderers
programmatically, all formatting props must also be acceptia via a context.

<Canvas withSource={SourceState.OPEN}>
  <BooleanRenderer value={true} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas withSource={SourceState.OPEN}>
  <BooleanRendererContext.Provider value={{yes: 'it is the way'}}>
    <BooleanRenderer value={true} />
  </BooleanRendererContext.Provider>
</Canvas>

Of course, these examples are just for booleans. What do we do when we truly
have no idea what data we might get? Enter the `AnyRenderer`

<Canvas withSource={SourceState.OPEN}>
  <React.Fragment>
    <AnyRenderer value={true} />
    <br />
    <AnyRenderer value={'2020-01-01'} />
    <br />
    <AnyRenderer value={5} />
    <br />
    <AnyRenderer value={null} />
    <br />
  </React.Fragment>
</Canvas>

<Canvas withSource={SourceState.OPEN}>
  <React.Fragment>
    <AnyRendererContext.Provider value={{boolean: {yes: 'it is the way'}}}>
      <AnyRenderer value={true} />
      <br />
      <AnyRenderer value={'2020-01-01'} />
      <br />
      <AnyRenderer value={5} />
      <br />
      <AnyRenderer value={null} />
      <br />
    </AnyRendererContext.Provider>
  </React.Fragment>
</Canvas>

Now, with the `AnyRenderer`, we put put any arbitrary data on a page and get
something fairly reasonable. Most of it its per-type renderers support
customization, so if we have a partial understanding of our data, we can
customize appropriately via the Context and programmatically drive our output.

This opens a lot of interesting possibilities for data-driven tables.
